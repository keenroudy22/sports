"""Publish model v2 forecasts for upcoming games. Deterministic, stdlib only.

Every run refits the team model and player projections from all stored games
that have finished, then writes a snapshot for each game in site/data/slate.json
that kicks off in the next eight days and more than an hour from now. A game
gets a new snapshot only on a material change (margin or total by half a point,
the injury list, or a player's volume by a tenth), so the history shows every
forecast that was public and when without near-duplicates. Snapshots append to
data/forecasts/<league>-<season>.jsonl and are never edited; the scoreboard
grades the last one published before kickoff.

Inputs stored with every snapshot: the games it was fit on (count, last kickoff
and a hash of their event IDs and contents), the model version (its fixed
parameters live in scripts/model_v2.py), both teams' ratings and which players
the injury report removed. Nothing here reads a market price.

Usage: python scripts/forecast.py
