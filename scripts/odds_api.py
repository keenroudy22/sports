"""Spreads and totals across books from The Odds API, captured before kickoff on a credit budget.

One call per league returns every upcoming game with each book's spread and total
(DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, BetRivers, ESPN BET, Fanatics). Each capture is
appended to data/odds/<league>-<season>.jsonl only when a game's numbers changed, with
the retrieval time; the board shows the best price per side and names the book, and
the scoreboard can grade closing-line value against the book a pick was taken at.

The free tier is 500 credits a month. A call costs 2 (two markets, one bookmaker group),
so the script paces itself: a league is captured only when it has a game inside two
days, at least 3.5 hours after its last capture, at most three times a day (four on its
big day), and never below a 24-credit reserve. data/odds/status.json carries the pacing
state and the last usage headers between runs, hosted or local.

The key comes from the ODDS_API_KEY environment variable and is never written to a log,
a URL in the store, or the repository. Without it the script prints that it skipped and
exits 0, so the hosted workflow runs whether or not the secret is set.

Usage: python scripts/odds_api.py
Stdlib only.
