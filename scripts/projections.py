"""Player volume projections. Deterministic, stdlib only.

For each team in a game, from games before the cutoff:

  plays      average of the offense's recent plays and what the defense allows
  pass rate  the offense's recent dropback rate, moved by the forecast margin
             (favorites run more; the slope is fit on past games against the
             closing spread)
  volume     dropbacks, rushes, targets, pass attempts and sacks from those

Each player's share of targets, carries and pass attempts comes from recent
games the player played for that team, with NFL snap counts marking who was on the
field. A pseudo-game at zero share keeps one big game from setting a role.
Catch rate and yards per target, carry and attempt are shrunk toward position
averages learned from the same games. Players listed out are removed live and
their share is spread over the rest. Ranges come from walk-forward residuals.
