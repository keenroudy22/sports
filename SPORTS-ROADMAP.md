# KeenRoudy Sports: league coverage and rollout

Updated September 29, 2026. The intended long-term coverage is NFL, FBS college football, NBA, WNBA, men's college
basketball, MLB, NHL, the Premier League and MLS under Kook'n Sports. Prioritize FanDuel and DraftKings with Indiana
as the market-availability verification jurisdiction. Confirm current rules and each exact offered market; naming a
jurisdiction alone does not verify availability.

## First implemented expansion

- NFL and FBS college football retain their existing research, game pages, picks and season records. Their original event IDs and football week rules remain intact.
- `scripts/sports_refresh.py` writes `site/data/sports.json` for NBA, WNBA, men's college basketball, MLB, NHL, the
  Premier League and MLS schedules and scores. It makes three bounded public ESPN requests per league for today and
  the next two dates in America/Indianapolis. It does not create a new background process or scheduler.
- The September 29 expansion snapshot returned WNBA, MLB, NHL and MLS games while NBA, college basketball and the
  Premier League had none in their three-day windows. A verified empty window is not a claim that a season has no games.
- Each game carries a league-qualified provider event ID, ET calendar date, season, teams, supplied game link, provider status and observed scores. MLB doubleheaders keep distinct event IDs. Scheduled games display no placeholder 0–0 result.
- Each league has its own last successful check, last attempt, source and coverage flags. A failed date refresh preserves the entire last good league snapshot and its original timestamp; an empty verified response differs from unavailable data.
- Odds, props, forecasts and official picks are **not enabled** merely by this score expansion. The score feed does
  not imply researched betting coverage. NBA and college totals already have a separate silent paper-trial path;
  MLB and NHL now have a separate append-only market lab (`scripts/market_lab.py`, `data/market-lab/`) that preserves
  supplied DraftKings pregame totals, moneylines, run/puck lines, changed snapshots and final scores. It makes no
  prediction and applies no settlement rule. The other sports still need sport-specific models, usable prices and
  settlement checks.
- Refresh hook for the existing hosted workflow: `python scripts/sports_refresh.py`, before committing `site/data`. No extra scheduled run is needed. The hosted source check remains periodic rather than a continuous live score feed.

Validation: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_sports_refresh.py` covers final and upcoming games, interrupted responses, stale-data preservation, unavailable versus empty slates, ET dates, doubleheaders, deduplication and mismatched provider identities. Deployment and mobile presentation are separate release checks.

`python -m unittest tests.test_market_lab` covers live-feed exclusion, exact supplied prices, changed-snapshot
deduplication, append-only final joins and unavailable prices. The desk runs this silent capture beside basketball's
paper trials at 11:45 AM, 5:30 PM and 11:30 PM Eastern. It adds no paid or metered odds call.

## Shared foundation

Season futures are a separate preseason track across every supported sport. Championship, conference/division,
playoff qualification and season-total markets begin with an append-only original-price ledger when each league's
markets open; awards wait for reliable player eligibility and settlement coverage. Research watches never count as
daily plays, and no future becomes official until its sport has a defensible season model, a verified exact price,
complete settlement rules and owner approval. The detailed rollout is in `docs/FUTURES.md`.

Player research now has a searchable directory at #players and separate #player/<league>/<athleteId> pages. It indexes only verified identities already present in gathered research, preserving separate market thresholds, game windows and source dates. Sourced identity snapshots add team names and colors without implying health or starter status. Picks remain short and link to those pages for graphs, logs, workload and line-history detail. NBA/MLB player research remains unavailable until its independent activation gates pass.

The next implemented research layer adds exact-line Last 5/10/20, recorded-season, opponent and home/away comparisons, with average/median/sample and source game logs. A separate NFL defense panel shows individual same-position results from up to five prior regular-season games for the upcoming followed matchup. It distinguishes group totals from individual props and labels prior-season samples. These are descriptive views; predictions and official pick grades remain unchanged.

Public product research on September 17: [PlayerProps.ai](https://playerprops.ai/predictor) advertises projections, odds and line movement; [Props.cash](https://props.cash/) combines historical research and roster context; [Outlier's NFL matchup guide](https://help.outlier.bet/en/articles/9876037-researching-defensive-matchups-for-nfl-player-props) demonstrates supporting stats and defense versus position. This site adopts the useful research workflow with its own presentation and sourced data. No paid service or competitor data access was purchased. Complete historical bookmaker odds, broader real-time quote coverage and licensed advanced metrics remain separate data-integration work; [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/liveapi/guides/v4/#get-historical-odds) documents historical odds as a paid feature.

- Use sport, league, season and provider event IDs on games, players, markets, quotes, predictions and results. Preserve all existing football IDs and links.
- Reuse favorites, broad watch boards, original-price ledgers, one-unit tracking, parlay tiers, calculators, research notes and pregame quote history.
- Separate market definition, period, direction, threshold, price, book, source, observation time and settlement rules. Do not assume every market is a full-game football stat.
- Keep original predictions, picks, prices and favorite designations immutable. Revisions append history rather than replacing it.
- Keep league-specific records and model evaluations. Offer combined betting returns only with explicit missing-price coverage; never combine unlike score-accuracy measures.
- Separate data-provider adapters and sport-specific research/settlement logic from presentation. Preserve last good data with visible freshness and source failures.

## Sport-specific requirements

| Area | NBA | MLB |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Calendar | Date, slate and season; no football week assumptions | Date, season and doubleheader game number; postponements and rescheduled games |
| Role research | Minutes, starts, usage, rotation, injuries, rest and back-to-backs | Confirmed batting order, starting pitcher, handedness, bullpen availability and lineup changes |
| Matchup | Pace, possessions, opponent personnel and coverage | Pitch mix, platoon context, park, weather, roof status and opposing lineup |
| Markets | Points, rebounds, assists, combinations, threes, quarters and halves | Strikeouts, outs recorded, hits, total bases, runs/RBI, first five innings and full game |
| Settlement | Participation and book rules for injuries, overtime and partial periods | Listed-pitcher/action rules, scratches, shortened/suspended games and innings requirements |

Recent-form charts must use the exact market and window. Show sample size and role changes. Football models, confidence scales and hit rates must not be treated as validated NBA or MLB methods.

## Navigation and rollout

1. Keep the current football board and season history intact while introducing league navigation and NBA/MLB calendar slates. Test phone layouts and old links.
2. Audit additional free-source coverage, permissions, update cadence and exact FanDuel/DraftKings market prices independently for NBA and MLB. No assumed comprehensive API coverage or paid subscriptions.
3. Expand researched coverage to all four leagues; NBA and MLB are both in scope and do not require another choice between them. Activate each league independently when source coverage, sport-specific methods and settlement checks are ready. Preserve truthful schedules/scores-only labels until then.
4. Validate sport-specific settlement and original-price preservation before publishing official picks or parlays. Keep cross-sport tickets disabled until rules and genuine combined book prices are supported.
5. Retain NFL/CFB week filters, including Monday games and college Week 0; use dates and season filters for daily sports. Do not reuse football week numbering for NBA/MLB.
6. Design later scheduled research around each sport's start times and lineup-release patterns. Scope runs to upcoming games and meaningful changes to control usage. The initial read-only data refresh uses the existing hosted workflow and adds no schedule.
7. Add each league's futures opening window to the season calendar. Preserve the first verified quote and every
   later movement, keep paper watches apart from official futures, and do not use a daily odds budget to poll a
   months-long market.

Acceptance: football records unchanged; stable player/event identities; no doubleheader collisions; injury/scratch and postponement rules tested; duplicate revisions cannot double-count; missing prices never produce invented ROI; original pregame predictions remain auditable.

## Compact research workspace

The Picks & lines workspace now combines compact favorite rows with a broader sourced market catalog, exact-selection detail and a personal ticket draft. The home page leads to the line board, player explorer, ticket builder and season record. Players retain separate history and defense-matchup views. Favorites and official records never inherit visitor drafts or unreviewed catalog observations.

The catalog deliberately distinguishes current verified quotes from editorial references, comparison-feed observations and missing prices. A wider catalog does not establish comprehensive sportsbook coverage. Durable public observations live in `market-observations/`; the existing hosted refresh compiles them with research snapshots. No new polling process, paid data service or sportsbook account is introduced.

## Public address
The canonical site is https://keenroudy.com/sports/ in keenroudy22/sports. The original repository was renamed with its history intact. The root portfolio repository hosts the legacy /football-predictions/ redirect and preserves old game/results fragments. Keep this redirect when changing hosting; the local workspace folder retains its old name.
